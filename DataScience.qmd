# Sepal Length Density
Create kernel density for Sepal Length from Iris data set.
```{r Density}
y<-density(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

Identify the class, type, and structure of object y.
```{r Characteristics}
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)
```

Plot the density of Sepal Length from the Iris Data set.
```{r Plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(y)
```
